      You are an expert at parsing command-line tool documentation and extracting structured information.

      TASK: Parse the following tool documentation and extract comprehensive structured information.

      TOOL NAME: {tool_name}
      RAW DOCUMENTATION:
      {raw_output}

      INSTRUCTIONS:
      1. Analyze the raw output thoroughly to understand the tool's purpose and functionality
      2. Extract all available information about arguments, options, and usage patterns
      3. Categorize the tool based on its primary functions
      4. Clean and normalize all extracted data
      5. Return ONLY valid JSON matching the exact schema below

      REQUIRED OUTPUT SCHEMA:
      {{
        "tool_name": "{tool_name}",
        "description": "Clear, concise description of what the tool does",
        "usage_template": "Primary usage pattern (e.g., 'toolname [options] arguments')",
        "categories": ["primary-category", "secondary-category"],
        "arguments": [
          {{
            "name": "argument_name",
            "description": "What this argument does",
            "required": true/false,
            "type": "string/number/file/etc",
            "multiple": true/false
          }}
        ],
        "options": [
          {{
            "flag": "-x",
            "name": "descriptive_name", 
            "description": "What this option does",
            "required": false,
            "has_parameter": true/false,
            "parameter_name": "param_name or null"
          }}
        ],
        "examples": [
          {{
            "command": "full command example",
            "description": "what this example demonstrates"
          }}
        ]
      }}

      CATEGORIZATION GUIDELINES:
      - dataset-management: Tools for managing MicroFocus datasets
      - file-operations: File copying, viewing, editing, conversion
      - job-management: Job submission, monitoring, cancellation
      - development: Debugging, tracing, error analysis
      - search: Finding, filtering, scanning tools
      - system: System utilities, database operations
      - analysis: Performance analysis, reporting tools
      - utility: General purpose utilities

      PARSING RULES:
      1. Extract usage patterns from lines starting with "usage:" or "Usage:"
      2. Find arguments in "Parameters:", "positional arguments:", or similar sections
      3. Locate options in "options:", "optional arguments:", or flag descriptions
      4. Extract examples from "examples:", "e.g.:", "example:", or similar sections
      5. Infer categories from tool name, description, and functionality
      6. Normalize flag formats (ensure proper dash usage)
      7. Clean up descriptions (remove extra whitespace, fix formatting)
      8. For MicroFocus tools, include dataset-management as a category when applicable

      QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
      - All extracted text must be clean and properly formatted
      - Categories must be relevant and specific (max 3 categories)
      - Examples must be complete, working commands when possible
      - Descriptions must be clear and informative
      - All required fields must be present
      - Arguments should distinguish between required positional args and optional parameters
